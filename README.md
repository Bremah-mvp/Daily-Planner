DAILY PLANNER APPLICATION.
A great way to get on top of your schedule and get all your activities done on time.

TOOLS USED TO CREATE THE APP

HTML
I used html to design the structure or the first layout of the application.
CSS
I used css to add styles and coloring to make the application more attractive.
BOOTSTRAP
I used bootstrap to add more styles to the layout so the app can be even more atrractive and flexible.
JAVASCRIPT
Used javascript to make the app dynamic and activate all the functionality so the app can perfom its 
designated job.
MOMENT.JS
I used moment.js to add time and date to the application and enable the app to keep track of all the 
activities or plans that would be saved .

HOW IT WORKS
When you open the application it shows you the current date and time.
Presents you with time blocks that cover the entire standard working day time that you can scroll through.
A user can then save a even or plan with in the time blocks, it could be any of his daily activity schedule
and can be able to delete a specific event or change it to any other desired.
The time blocks have specific coloring indicating the exact hour of the day, past and future hours. 
Exact/present hour is transparent, past hours is teal, future hours is lime green.
